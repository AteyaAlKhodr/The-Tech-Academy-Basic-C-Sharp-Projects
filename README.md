# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects

This repo contains my C# projects and practice code from my learning journey.  
It includes exercises using **C#**, **.NET**, and **ASP.NET MVC**, where I learned about:

- Classes, methods, and interfaces  
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) basics  
- Operator overloading and polymorphism  
- Building simple web apps with MVC  
- Connecting to databases using Entity Framework  

## ðŸš€ Goals
Iâ€™m using this repo to keep improving my C# skills and experiment with small applications, and web projects.

## ðŸ’¡ About Me
Iâ€™m a beginner developer exploring how C# and .NET can be used to build real-world applications.
